## Dataset: [Network Intrusion Detection Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection)

Data Cleaning:
1. Checking and standardizing data types across variables to maintain uniformity.
2. Remove any duplicate records to maintain data integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Utilized various visualization techniques (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots) to depict distributions, trends and relationships among variables.
2. Implemented classification techniques such as SVC(finding the best hyperplane that separates the data into different classes) and KNN classifier(finding the k-nearest neighbors of a given data point and assigning it to the class that has the most number of neighbors).
3. Implemented useful tools for analyzing the performance of the models; some of which are SNS plot(visualization through graphs), heatmap (visualize the correlation between different features) and confusion matrix (comparison of predicted labels with actual labels).
